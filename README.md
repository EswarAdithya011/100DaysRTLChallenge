üöÄ 100 Days of RTL Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days RTL Design Challenge** repository!  
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of over 100 Verilog HDL-based digital design implementations ranging from basic gates to advanced system-level modules.

## üìå About the Challenge

This challenge was self-initiated to practice, organize, and master Verilog HDL coding with clean, synthesizable RTL. It includes behavioral, structural, dataflow, and mixed modeling styles, complete with testbenches and simulation support. All projects were coded and simulated using Vivado tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Xilinx Vivado 2024.1
